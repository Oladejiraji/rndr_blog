## What a year it has been.

A year full of wins, a year full of lessons, and most importantly a year of growth.

In March 2025, I, alongside three of my close friends, decided to start something. At the time, we weren't entirely sure what that something would become. What we did know was that we loved pushing the boundaries of what was possible on the web and that we were tired of boring, stale visuals.

Fast forward to now, we have a brand we're genuinely proud of. One that's already pushing us into spaces we wouldn't have reached otherwise, and one that still feels like it's only getting started.

## The Team

### Deji

I'm Deji, a software developer and, for lack of a better word, the generalist of the team, at least from a development standpoint. I fill the gaps across our software development cycle because, at the end of the day, what we build has to work. Strong visuals matter, but they're not enough on their own.

### Jason

Our Creative Director. Jason is a product designer and the source of most of our creative direction. He's responsible for our design decisions and the unique look and feel that define our work.

### Seun

Our creative frontend developer. Seun constantly pushes the envelope of what's possible on the web. He's responsible for our explorations always researching, experimenting, and finding new ways to turn ideas into experiences.

### Abims

Our motion and brand designer. Abims brings everything to life through motion. He obsesses over easing curves (sometimes a bit too much, lol), and he's responsible for the motion on our site, our reels, and our exploration recordings.

Together, we form a small, focused, and flexible team. We're aware of our strengths, honest about our weaknesses, and committed to pushing ourselves and the work as far as possible.

## Our Wins So Far

We have been fortunate to see early momentum. This year, we secured our first retainer and worked on multiple projects that challenged us creatively and technically. These wins mean a lot to us, not just because of the work itself, but because they reaffirmed that there is space for the kind of studio we are building.

## What We Will Be Sharing Here

This blog will be a place where we openly share how we work. We will be writing about our process, breaking down our explorations, and explaining concepts that shape the way we think about design and the web.

Some posts will be reflective, some will be experimental, and others will simply document what we are learning as we build. The goal is to be honest, useful, and clear.

## What's Next

Our landing page is coming soon and will serve as a clearer window into who we are and what we do.

Looking into the next year, our focus is simple. We want to grow, take on more meaningful work, and continue refining our craft. We are open to working with new clients who care about thoughtful design and well-built experiences.

If that sounds like you, we would love to talk.
