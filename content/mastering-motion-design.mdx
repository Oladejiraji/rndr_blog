# Mastering Motion Design in React

Motion design has become an essential part of creating engaging user experiences. In this article, we'll explore the principles and techniques for implementing smooth, performant animations in React applications.

## Introduction

**MDX** allows you to use JSX in your markdown content, making it incredibly powerful for creating interactive blog posts. You can write regular markdown and seamlessly integrate React components.

### Code Blocks

Here's a JavaScript code example:

```javascript {2-4} title=Get World Position
// Example: React Server Component
export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```
